# Scope of the Game
## Plans for the game, plot ideas, gameplay, etcetera

### Gameplay
* Top down, final fantasy style RPG
* Battles in turn based fashion, any way to mix this up?
* See enemies when walking around overworld
* How big are we going to make the map?
* Would need to have a bag or something to store items
* Will the player move around the screen or be locked to the center?

### Plot
* I want to write something funny/sarcastic (Ryan)
* Set in the university?
* Time Travel?
* Actual fighting?
* Silly fighting using coursework?

### Style
* Are we still thinking pixel art style?
* Lighthearted vibes (Ryan)

### Implementation
* How are we going to handle storing levels?
* We should test to see what the most natural keyboard layouts are for people
* Vector movement or tile based?

### Future Plans
* Are we going to share this with other students?
* Should we do a lot of the code in the same way as the original MetaGame?
