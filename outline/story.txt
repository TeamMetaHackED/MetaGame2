[Player's House]:
(Player):
    Sweet!  I got into (University)!
    They've even got that super convenient for plot development time travel club
    there!

    I should enroll in my classes.  It's a good thing that they make things easy
    for game developers by just having one set of classes for each discipline!

{Pick Discipline}


*Skip to First Day*


[Campus]:
(Player):
    Cool, university.  These last few months really flew by though, like
    seriously, I blinked and here I am.

Orientation Leader:
    Welcome to (University) University!  You should sign up for some clubs and
    stuff.

    {Takes (Player) to the only clubs table}
    Like really, clubs rock.

    {If (Player) tries to leave, Orientation Leader stops him}
        No!  You can't leave without signing up for a club!  There's so many
        that you should have no problem picking one

    {Player signs up for club}
        Club Guy:
            Welcome to the club!  Our first meeting is today during the break
            you have between classes, so you have no reason not to come


[First Class]:
(Professor):
    Hi, this is (Discipline) 101, the class where we teach you how to do school
    stuff.  You should read the syllabus because it says everything we'll be
    doing.  Regardless, I'll be taking this class to read the whole
    thing to all of you.

    {Tutorial}
    Well, hopefully that makes sense to you, because we'll be doing this the
    whole semester.  That's everything I had planned for this class, but I'm
    contractually obligated to keep you for the entire 50 minutes, so just talk
    with other students I guess.

    {Can talk to students or leave class}
        -> Leave class
        (Player):
            Cool, so that was interesting.  I guess I'll go to that club now


[Time Travel Club]:
(Club leader):
    Hi

    {If (Player) tries to leave}
        Ok, looks like you're the only one coming.

        (Player):
            Really?  I thought this was the only club

        (Club Leader):
            Technically no, this is just the only one that's accessible to
            anyone

        (Player):
            Oh

        (Club Leader):
            Also, if you hadn't shown up today, I would have made it really
            awkward for you to come later.

            Anyway, this is the time travel club.  We're building a time machine.
            Wanna try it?

            {Repeat until (Player agrees)}
